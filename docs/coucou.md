# Coucou

Coucou is a collaboration tool used to manage events, actions, requests, journaling and more.

The tool employs a three-column layout, consisting of navigation, editor/view, and
contextual information sections.

## Navigation

Objects in Cocuou are stored in collections, whereby there is some relationship (either explicit or implied)
between objects in the same collection. Collections may also be nested in a hierarchical folder structure
for additional grouping of similar collections.

Collections and folders exist in the context of a workspace, which supports access management, workflows,
integration channels, and more.

From the navigation sections users can switch between workspaces, create and maintain collections and folders,
and manage objects.

## Editor

Object selection (or creation) in the navigation section will open an appropriate editor view for that object.

Editor contents are derived from populating the associated template with the object component (and sub-component)
properties.

## Context
