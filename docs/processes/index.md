# Processes

Processes define common ways of working with collaborative teams. We use processes to
form a shared understanding how we interact within and across teams, and also how we
track such activities.

## Tool Lock-in

Processes constantly evolve, with old processes being replaced with new ones, and often
this includes tool replacement. Such dependency on tooling is obviously a process
anti-pattern, but how can it be addressed?

## Open Standards

Instead of aligning processes to tools, they should be aligned to standards that are
supported by the tools. In this way, processes and tools can evolve independently
as long as they are compliant with the common standards.
